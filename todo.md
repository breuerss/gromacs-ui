# Open issues

1. disable configuration during run
1. import from directory
1. Proper project handling, distinction between project, import from directory structure
1. loading source structure from drive
1. simulation steps should only be runnable if source structure is available

1. system setup template names should be defined in system setup, regenerate signal should be used instead of value set

1. visualisation presets do not allow to filter out molecule groups

1. reset output on new project

1. notify user if project name is already in use in project dir to avoid overwriting?


1. default settings for different force fields
1. constraints config

1. simplify widgets updates
1. logger instead of QDebug

# Pipeline implementation

1. Filter
1. Loading starting configuration for different simulations
1. Save and restore pipelines
1. Show few settings options in node
1. save location of nodes
1. alignment options
1. execution of whole pipeline
1. detect if node can be executed
1. improve connectors path
1. cleanup pionter handling, use naked pointers where memory management is not a factor
1. Coloring of ports to be clear about the accepted file types
1. show information of selected options in short form
1. multiple selection should reset configuration view
1. simulation status should be shown
